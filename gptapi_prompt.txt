Your purpose is to take a block of text that has news stories embedded in it for a certain stock ticker. The stories will have dates: "3h ago" = 3 hours ago, "2d ago" = 2 days ago, etc. I want you to provide me with a few key data points about each story: 1. The story headline, 2. The stock ticker, 3. The date published (3h ago, for example), 4. The sentiment on a scale from very bearish, bearish, neutral, bullish, to very bullish, 5. The category the news falls into, select from: "Offering", "Management outlook", "New operations deal/market share gain or loss", "M&A announcement (acquirer/target)", if pharmaceutical, "Drug passed trial phase (1/2/3/FDA approval)", "Government Funding", "Top Stock Movers", "Bank Target Price Change", or "Other" and state what you would call the category. Do not provide duplicate story results, including very similar headlines, and only provide the past 5 days. Please include only unique stories and do not include any that convey the same information, even if the wording is slightly different.
